    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    
 The objective for my application was essentially to give clients an apparatus to use to keep up with or get them in the shape they like with fostering the weight following application they would have the option to count calories, track steps and weight, and have a custom exercise plan that squeezes into their lives. This application wasn't intended to put individuals down about their weight yet to allow them to utilize it and assume command over their ongoing circumstances this doesn't mean simply getting thinner, some might need to acquire body muscle or get into a better way of life so this was made considering that.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    
    The screen highlights started with the login interaction in which users input their username and secret phrase, after they sign in they will be given their everyday data and objectives for the ongoing day and week. The screen will show their everyday advances and the number of steps is expected to arrive at the objective for the afternoon. It will likewise incorporate the miles, calories, and floors they strolled, Having the information before them will spur them to continue onward while planning something that is easy to understand.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
   
    I adopted an iterative strategy to design and code this application. There were a lot of necessities that should have been separated into more modest objectives and assignments.
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    
    Running and testing my application was the most troublesome aspect of this task as I had made numerous blunders. This was a significant component since ensuring each work is legitimate will decide the outcome of this application and keep in mind that it works in different areas, the others were simply too challenging to even consider sorting out in the time I had. This area is significant for the way that security takes a chance with calculating into user certifications are being put away in this application so we needed to have this space be quite close for a positive users experience.
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    
    I essentially kept the UI parts yet kept comparative value. I at first needed to use a possibility for users to control a body type that matches their however chosen not to and felt free to make a rundown of shapes all things being equal. I viewed this way as more exact and integrated that into the application.
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    
    I belive my seccess came from the design aspect of this whole project. I had alot on my mind that i wanted to add but there no just not enoguh time to input all of my ideas. Having as much ideas i had to could have hurted me or push me to the next level but i would never know. I like how I could communicate what my thoughts are and put everything down into this application which was the tomfoolery part of this venture and seeing everything meet up was incredibly fulfilling.
